// Summary:

//     What is locked?
//         The ReentrantLock objects associated with the first and second Account objects are locked.
//         The critical section that is protected by the locks is the balance modification logic (i.e., this.balance -= amount; and destination.balance += amount;).
//     Is it only the try block thatâ€™s protected?
//         The critical section inside the try block, where the actual money transfer occurs, is protected by the locks.
//         The locking itself occurs before the try block, but the actual operations on the account balances (which could lead to data inconsistency) are inside the try block.

// By locking the accounts in a consistent order and ensuring that only one thread can modify the balances of both accounts at the same time, the code avoids race conditions and ensures thread safety.
