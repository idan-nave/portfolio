     * Procedural Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming:
     * - Procedural programming is based on the concept of procedure calls (functions) and 
     *   focuses on the sequence of tasks to perform.
     * - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is based on the concept of objects and classes 
     *   that encapsulate data and behavior.
     *
     * Four Pillars of OOP:
     * 1. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary parts.
     * 2. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data together, restricting access to some components.
     * 3. Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods from another class.
     * 4. Polymorphism: The ability to take many forms, allowing methods to behave differently based on the object.
     *
     * Example of Abstraction in Real Life:
     * - A TV remote is an example of abstraction. You only see the buttons and interact with them, but the internal
     *   mechanisms of the TV remote and the TV itself are hidden from you.
