# `calc` - A Java Project for Demonstrating Operators

This is a basic Java project that demonstrates the use of various operators in Java. The project contains examples of arithmetic, increment/decrement, logical, assignment, comparison, bitwise operators, and modulus. Additionally, the project combines logical and comparison operators to create an expression that checks if a number lies between two values.

## Project Structure

```

├── src/                               # Source code directory
│   └── calc/                          # Package for the calc project
│       └── ArithmeticOperators.java   # Contains the logic for arithmetic, increment, logical, comparison, bitwise, and modulus operators
├── src/test/java/                     # Directory for test classes
│   └── calc/                          # Package for tests
│       └── ArithmeticOperatorsTest.java # Contains unit tests for the ArithmeticOperators class
├── .gitignore                         # Git ignore file to ignore compiled files and other unnecessary files
└── README.md                          # This file, containing project information
```

### Files Overview:

1. **`ArithmeticOperators.java`**:
   - Contains the logic for demonstrating various operators in Java.
   - Includes examples of:
     - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
     - Increment and Decrement (`++x`, `x++`)
     - Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
     - Assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`)
     - Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
     - Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`)
     - Modulus operations

2. **`ArithmeticOperatorsTest.java`**:
   - Contains unit tests that validate the logic in the `ArithmeticOperators.java` class.
   - Tests basic arithmetic and comparison operations.

3. **`.gitignore`**:
   - Specifies files to be ignored by Git (e.g., `.class` files and compiled output).

4. **`README.md`**:
   - Provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions on how to compile and run the code.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository or extract the project files:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd calc
```

### 2. Compile the Java program

You can compile the Java code using the following command:

```bash
javac -d bin src/calc/ArithmeticOperators.java
javac -d bin src/calc/*.java
```

This will compile the `ArithmeticOperators.java` file and store the output `.class` files in the `bin` directory.

### 3. Run the program

After compilation, you can run the program using:

```bash
java -cp bin calc.ArithmeticOperators
java -cp bin calc.Main
```
-cp (or -classpath): This flag specifies the classpath for the Java application. The classpath tells the Java runtime where to look for compiled .class files or other resources needed by the program.
This will output the results of all the operations performed in the program.

### 4. Running Unit Tests (Optional)

To run the unit tests, follow these steps:

- Compile the test class:

```bash
javac -d bin src/test/java/calc/ArithmeticOperatorsTest.java
javac -d bin src/test/java/calc/*.java

```

- Run the tests using JUnit:

```bash
java -cp bin org.junit.runner.JUnitCore calc.ArithmeticOperatorsTest
```

### 5. Clean and Build

To clean the compiled files and rebuild the project, use the following commands:

- Clean the project:

```bash
rm -rf bin/*
```

- Rebuild the project (compile the code again):

```bash
javac -d bin src/calc/ArithmeticOperators.java
```

## Explanation of the Code

- **Arithmetic Operators**: The program demonstrates addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus with two numbers (10 and 5).
  
- **Increment and Decrement**: The program shows both pre-increment (`++x`) and post-increment (`x++`) operations and prints their effects on the value of a variable.
  
- **Logical Operators**: A combination of logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) is tested with `true` and `false` values.

- **Assignment Operators**: The program demonstrates how assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) can modify the value of a variable.

- **Comparison Operators**: It compares two numbers using the comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and prints whether the condition is true or false.

- **Bitwise Operators**: The program demonstrates bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), left shift (`<<`), and right shift (`>>`) operations on integers.

- **Practical Use of Logical and Comparison Operators**: The program checks if a number is between 10 and 20 using a combination of logical and comparison operators.

- **Modulus**: The program prints the remainder when dividing numbers from 1 to 10 by a constant value (3 in this case).

## Conclusion

This project provides an easy-to-follow example of various Java operators, demonstrating their use and behavior in different scenarios. You can expand this project by adding more complex logic or tests. The project is kept simple for educational purposes, ideal for understanding how operators work in Java.
