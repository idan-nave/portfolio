# Specify phony targets (targets that are not files)

# By marking all as phony, you're telling make that it's not an actual file that needs to be created.
#Instead, make should consider it a target that needs to be executed whenever you run make without any
# arguments.

# When you run make clean, the recipe associated with the clean target is executed, and it removes the 
# specified files. Marking it as phony ensures that make knows it's not producing a file named "clean".

# Default target
# The 'all' target is the default target that will be executed when you run 'make' without any arguments.
# It depends on the binary file, so 'make' will execute the recipe to build the binary.
