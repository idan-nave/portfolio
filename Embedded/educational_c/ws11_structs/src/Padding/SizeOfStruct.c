/* Bit-fields RULES
#

    Arrays of bit-fields, pointers to bit-fields and functions returning bit-fields are not allowed.
    The address operator (&) cannot be applied to bit-field members.
    The data type of a bit-field must be wide enough to contain the size of the field.
    The sizeof() operator cannot be applied to a bit-field.
    There is no way to create a typedef for a bit-field in isolation (though you can certainly create a typedef for a structure containing bit-fields).

typedef struct mybitfield
{
    unsigned char c1 : 20;    incorrect, see point 3 
    unsigned char c2 : 4;     correct 
    unsigned char c3 : 1;
    unsigned int x[10]: 5;    incorrect, see point 1 
} A;

int SomeFunction(void)
{
    // Somewhere in the code
    A a = { â€¦ };
    printf("Address of a.c2 is %p\n", &a.c2);       incorrect, see point 2 
    printf("Size of a.c2 is %zu\n", sizeof(a.c2));  incorrect, see point 4 
}
